What does the model achieve?
- Derives a linear correlation between Simulation run time and Number of Nodes used during the simulation set up.

How should metrics be interpreted?
- Slope is the relationship between the number of nodes per simulation and the run time (hrs).

What are appropriate use cases?
- Correlation of the two variables (Run time and Nunumber of Nodes) with the expectation that the relationship is linear

How is it implemented? *
- The way it is implemented is by finding a best-fitting line for data we have by finding the lowest cost (error).

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
- Benchmarking Molecular Dynamic Simulations requires comparison of varing atom counts to yield an accurate prediction time for a given system, e.g. 20,000, 200,000, 2,000,000.

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
- Simulation run time is reduced linearly with respect to number of nodes used on the Spartan HPC. The more compute nodes used reduces run time for simulations.
